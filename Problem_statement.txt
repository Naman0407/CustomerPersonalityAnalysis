In this project, I will analyse customer data from a grocery firm's database and apply unsupervised learning techniques for data clustering. Customer segmentation involves grouping customers with similar traits. My goal is to segment customers in a way that maximizes the value each one brings to the business. Additionally, I aim to customize products to cater to the diverse needs and behaviours of customers, allowing the business to respond more effectively to the expectations of different customer groups.
